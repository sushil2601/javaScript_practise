Q.) what is event loop?

Ans:- The JavaScript Event Loop is a core part of the JavaScript runtime that enables asynchronous behavior while still being single-threaded. To understand it thoroughly, we need to break it down into parts: the Call Stack, Web APIs, Callback Queue, and the Event Loop itself.

🔁 What is the Event Loop?
The event loop continuously monitors the call stack and the callback queue. It pushes tasks from the queue to the stack when the stack is empty, allowing asynchronous operations to execute in a non-blocking way.

🧠 Key Concepts
1. Call Stack
JavaScript executes code synchronously.

The call stack is a data structure that records function calls.

When a function is invoked, it is added to the stack; once done, it's popped off.

Example:

js
Copy
Edit
function greet() {
  console.log('Hello');
}
greet(); // 'greet' is pushed to the call stack and then popped
2. Web APIs (or Browser APIs)
When you use functions like setTimeout, fetch, or DOM events, they are offloaded to browser-provided APIs.

These APIs handle the tasks asynchronously and notify JavaScript when done.

Example:

js
Copy
Edit
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('Timeout done');
}, 1000);
setTimeout is handed over to the browser.

After 1 second, it moves the callback to the callback queue.

3. Callback Queue (Task Queue)
Stores callback functions waiting to be executed.

Only when the call stack is empty does the event loop move the next callback from the queue to the stack.

4. Microtask Queue
Holds Promises and other microtasks (queueMicrotask, MutationObserver).

Has higher priority than the callback queue.

After every task, the event loop first checks and clears microtasks before moving on.

🧪 Example to Show Order
js
Copy
Edit
console.log('1');

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('2');
}, 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log('3');
});

console.log('4');
Execution Flow:
console.log('1') → prints 1

setTimeout(...) → sent to Web API, then to callback queue

Promise.then(...) → added to microtask queue

console.log('4') → prints 4

Call stack is empty → event loop checks microtask queue → prints 3

Then checks callback queue → prints 2

Output:

1
4
3

Microtask	Promises, queueMicrotask	          High
Macrotask	setTimeout, setInterval, DOM Events	  Lower

📌 Why is this Important?
Helps you write non-blocking code

Understand Promise chaining, setTimeout delays

Debug issues with asynchronous flows

✅ Summary
JavaScript is single-threaded but asynchronous due to the event loop.

The call stack runs functions; async tasks go to Web APIs.

Once async work is complete, callbacks go to the task queue or microtask queue.

The event loop checks if the call stack is empty and moves tasks accordingly.

Microtasks run before macrotasks.


Q.) What is a JavaScript Engine?

Ans :-

he JavaScript engine is the component that reads, parses, compiles, and executes JavaScript code. Understanding its architecture is crucial to mastering how JavaScript actually runs under the hood, especially when dealing with performance, memory, and async behavior.

⚙️ What is a JavaScript Engine?
A JavaScript Engine is a program (usually embedded in a web browser or runtime like Node.js) that executes JavaScript code.

The most well-known engines include:

V8 (used in Chrome, Node.js)

SpiderMonkey (Firefox)

JavaScriptCore (Safari)

Chakra (Edge legacy)

For this explanation, we'll focus on V8, as it's the most widely used and best-documented.

🏗️ V8 JavaScript Engine Architecture
The V8 engine consists of several major components:

└──────────────────────┘
🔍 Breakdown of Components
1. Parser + Scanner
Scanner (Lexer): Converts raw code into tokens (keywords, operators, etc.).

Parser: Takes those tokens and builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

AST is a tree representation of the source code structure.

2. Interpreter (Ignition)
Converts the AST into bytecode, a lower-level representation.

Bytecode is faster to execute than raw JS but slower than machine code.

Executes code immediately, so startup is fast.

🔹 Example: let x = 2 + 3 → Bytecode instructions like LoadLiteral, Add, Store

3. Profiler
Tracks how often functions run ("hot" code).

Collects type feedback.

Detects patterns worth optimizing.

4. JIT Compiler (TurboFan)
"Just-In-Time" compilation of hot functions.

Compiles frequently-run bytecode to optimized machine code.

Inlines functions, removes dead code, and applies other performance tricks.

5. Garbage Collector
Manages memory allocation and automatically frees up unused memory.

Uses generational garbage collection:

Young generation (short-lived objects)

Old generation (long-lived objects)

🔄 Execution Process Summary
JavaScript source code is passed to the parser.

Parser creates the AST.

AST is interpreted by Ignition, which generates and runs bytecode.

Profiler monitors the code execution.

Frequently executed code is optimized by TurboFan into machine code.

Machine code is executed directly by the CPU for peak performance.

🧠 Why V8 Uses Both Interpreter and Compiler
Ignition (Interpreter)	TurboFan (Compiler)
Fast startup	Slower to start
Less optimized	Highly optimized code
Used for all code initially	Used for hot code only

This combination is known as adaptive optimization.

🗑️ Garbage Collection (GC)
JavaScript engines also include Garbage Collectors to clean up memory:

Detects objects no longer in use.

Uses algorithms like mark-and-sweep.

V8 uses generational GC to manage memory efficiently.

⚡ Performance Tips (based on the engine)
Avoid frequent object shape changes.

Use consistent object keys and types.

Minimize usage of eval() and with.

Use async patterns efficiently — avoid blocking the main thread.

Let the engine optimize — don’t fight it with overly clever code.
