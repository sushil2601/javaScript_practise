# Q. What is cloud?
Ans :-

    .Cloud computing is a technology that allows users to access computing resources like servers, storage, databases, and applications over the internet, instead of maintaining physical hardware or data centers.

    .It works on a pay-as-you-go model, meaning you pay only for what you use.
    The main idea is to provide on-demand availability of IT resources — scalable, flexible, and cost-effective — through the cloud service provider.

# Q. Types :-
Ans :-

    .There are three main service models in cloud computing:

    .IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) – Provides virtualized computing resources like servers and storage.
        Example: AWS EC2, Azure VM

    .PaaS (Platform as a Service) – Offers a platform for developers to build and deploy applications.
        Example: Google App Engine, Heroku

    .SaaS (Software as a Service) – Ready-to-use software accessible via the internet.
        Example: Gmail, Microsoft 365, Salesforce
